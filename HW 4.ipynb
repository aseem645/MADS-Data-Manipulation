    "# Assignment 4\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this assignment you must read in a file of metropolitan regions and associated sports teams from [assets/wikipedia_data.html](assets/wikipedia_data.html) and answer some questions about each metropolitan region. Each of these regions may have one or more teams from the \"Big 4\": NFL (football, in [assets/nfl.csv](assets/nfl.csv)), MLB (baseball, in [assets/mlb.csv](assets/mlb.csv)), NBA (basketball, in [assets/nba.csv](assets/nba.csv) or NHL (hockey, in [assets/nhl.csv](assets/nhl.csv)). Please keep in mind that all questions are from the perspective of the metropolitan region, and that this file is the \"source of authority\" for the location of a given sports team. Thus teams which are commonly known by a different area (e.g. \"Oakland Raiders\") need to be mapped into the metropolitan region given (e.g. San Francisco Bay Area). This will require some human data understanding outside of the data you've been given (e.g. you will have to hand-code some names, and might need to google to find out where teams are)!\n",
    "\n",
    "For each sport I would like you to answer the question: **what is the win/loss ratio's correlation with the population of the city it is in?** Remember that to calculate the correlation with [`pearsonr`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html), so you are going to send in two ordered lists of values, the populations from the wikipedia_data.html file and the win/loss ratio for a given sport in the same order. Average the win/loss ratios for those cities which have multiple teams of a single sport. Each sport is worth an equal amount in this assignment (20%\\*4=80%) of the grade for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I would like you to explore the hypothesis that **given that an area has two sports teams in different sports, those teams will perform the same within their respective sports**. How I would like to see this explored is with a series of paired t-tests (so use [`ttest_rel`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html)) between all pairs of sports. Are there any sports where we can reject the null hypothesis? Again, average values where a sport has multiple teams in one region. Remember, you will only be including, for each sport, cities which have teams engaged in that sport, drop others as appropriate. This question is worth 20% of the grade for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Partial marks may be awarded if the answer is incorrect, or removed even if the answer is correct! Within each function show your understanding of course concepts such as regex, `groupby()`, `apply()`, etc. as appropriate to the question. If you unnecessarily hand code data in your functions instead of using pandas cleaning mechanisms you may be docked grades.\n",
    "2. Do not including data about the MLS or CFL in any of the work you are doing, we're only interested in the Big 4 in this assignment.\n",
    "3. I highly suggest that you first tackle the correlation questions, as they are all similar and worth the majority of grades for this assignment. This is by design!\n",
    "4. It's fair game to talk with peers about high level strategy as well as the relationship between metropolitan areas and sports teams. However, do not post code solving aspects of the assignment (including such as dictionaries mapping areas to teams, or regexes which will clean up names).\n",
    "5. This assignment **is not autograded**. Go to the course shell and upload your .ipynb file there as assignment4.ipynb.\n",
    "6. You can earn up to 100% on this assignment by creating correlations for a single year (2016) for which there is population data. You can earn up to 105% on this assignment by going further, and creating correlations for multiple years (e.g. across the years of data we have on the sports), but it's expected that there would be a short discussion of the limitations of your approach as far as interpretation goes. Finally, if you find new population data that covers a broader set of years and integrate it into a solution across these years and sports and provide that interpretation you can earn up to 110% on the assignment."

In other words, the performance between the teams is not the same.
